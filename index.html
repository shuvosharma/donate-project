            <p>Food Donation
                The primary focus of food waste prevention should be to act directly at source by limiting the generation of surplus food at each stage in the food supply chain (i.e. production, processing, distribution and consumption). If this cannot be achieved, the best destination for food surplus, which ensures the highest value use of edible food resources in line with the waste hierarchySearch for available translations of the preceding link is to redistribute this food for human consumption where safe to do so.</p>

           <p>The need for food, clothing and toiletries is continuous many of our residents come to us empty-handed, in need not only of shelter, but of basic possessions and sustenance as well. From socks and shoes to soap and sunscreen, we always welcome donations of new clothing and grooming accessories. Your gift of food items is also welcome such as bulk quantities of canned or dry goods in addition to gift certificates to price clubs or supermarkets.</p>

                <p>After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was hit again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases.<br> 
                    Up to this date, the flood has affected nearly 7 millions people throughout Bangladesh-worst-flood-hit areas. Most of the affected communities are the ones that are already living in very poor conditions and low economy households.<br>
                    The Bangladesh Government continues to mobilize resources to support the affected communities, such as basic food, water purification tablets, and cash grants. However, further support from charitable organizations and development partners is still desperately needed.</p>
